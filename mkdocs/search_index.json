This was a key factor in moving to the new platform. We have been consolidating the different interfaces our developers have expressed interest in to enable innovation around M-PESA. As expected, most of these are about the payment journeys, covering both disbursements (Business to Customers \u2013 B2C) and service payments (Customer to Business \u2013 C2B and Business to Business \u2013 B2B). These and other features are now available via secure Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow for third party applications to easily plug into M-PESA.",
